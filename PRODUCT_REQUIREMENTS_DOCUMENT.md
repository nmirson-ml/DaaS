## Executive Summary

We propose developing a white-label embedded analytics platform that enables our customers to create, customize, and embed sophisticated dashboards directly into their applications. This platform will serve as a comprehensive alternative to expensive solutions like Preset/Apache Superset while providing superior customization, multi-datasource connectivity, and seamless embedding capabilities.

**Market Opportunity:** The embedded analytics market is projected to grow from $68.88 billion in 2024 to $132.03 billion by 2029 (13.90% CAGR), representing a massive opportunity for capturing market share with a developer-focused, customizable solution.

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- **High Cost of Existing Solutions:** Current solutions like Preset, Tableau Embedded, and Looker Studio cost $20-50+ per user/month
- **Limited Customization:** Most platforms offer basic white-labeling (logo swaps) without deep UI/UX customization
- **Complex Integration:** Existing solutions require extensive development work to achieve seamless embedding
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Customers become dependent on proprietary query languages and data modeling approaches
- **Performance Issues:** iFrame-based embedding creates security risks and limits customization
- **Multi-tenancy Challenges:** Scaling across multiple customer tenants with proper data isolation

### Target Customer Segments
1. **B2B SaaS Companies** needing customer-facing analytics
2. **Enterprise Software Vendors** building analytics modules
3. **Consulting Firms** delivering custom analytics solutions
4. **Data Teams** seeking cost-effective Databricks/Preset alternatives

## 2. Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement
"Democratize embedded analytics by providing the most customizable, secure, and cost-effective platform for developers to build and embed sophisticated dashboards into any application."

### Strategic Objectives
- Capture 5% of the embedded analytics market within 3 years
